    <p>Online shopping is the activity or action of buying products or services over the Internet. It means going online, landing on a seller's website, selecting something, and arranging for its delivery. The buyer either pays for the good or service online with a credit or debit card or upon delivery.
       In this article, the term 'online'means 'on the Internet'.
       The term does not only include buying things online but also searching for them online. In other words, I may have been engaged in online shopping but did not buy anything.

       Today, we can purchase nearly anything online. In fact, retail experts say that online shopping will soon overtake traditional shopping in monetary terms.
